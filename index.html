                excellent was not important and very fulfilling for me, but I
                did not treat the people who pursued such path with

                pressured to be the same as them, and it did me good. My english

                All of the classes I have had in this school were conducted
                virtually because of the pandemic. I was again, not very used to
                it, and it's an entirely different environment. Initially, I was
                very sloppy, I had inconsistent sleep, and I was very critical
                of virtual classes and I deemed it as an ineffective medium of
                education. But I learned to live with it, I became flexible, I
                had full control of my time, and graduated with high honors.
                During this time, I was very passionate about the things that I
                do and I was at my peak. I learned many things such as coding,
                Japanese language, human physiology, psychology, politics, and
                philosophy.

                In contrast to my experience in senior high school when I was
                multi-tasking, I learned in here that if you want to be good or
                master something you have to invest all your time in your craft.
                The coding skills I learned in senior high school got
                reinforced. I also made very good friends and school life with
                them had been nothing but dopaminergic. I am surrounded with
                people who are completely different to me, people who have
                different set of skills, have bright personalities, are great
                communicators, are extrospective, and there is still so much to
                discover and learn from them and from this school, I'm looking
                forward to it.
