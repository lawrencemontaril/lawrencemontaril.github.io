                        I entered elementary a year younger than my peers. I did
                        okay during my first year, but in my second year I got
                        lazy and had a lot of absences. I did not really see the
                        importance of school back then, I just enough to get by
                        and used most of my time doing whatever I wanted.

                        Although I did not academically excel in elementary, I
                        did learn the fundamentals and values that I need to be
                        a decent person. And this was the time that I thought
                        that being academically excellent was not important and
                        very fulfilling for me, but I did not treat the people
                        who pursued such path with indifference.

                        Having a hostile relationship with school in my
                        elementary days, I initially thought junior high school
                        would be the same. During my preliminary assessment, I
                        was asked what I learned in elementary in English. I
                        understood the question, I had an answer, but not in
                        English. That is when it dawned on me on how behind I
                        was compared to most students academically. But they
                        accepted students like me regardless of how they did
                        during the assessments.
                      </p>
                      <p class="mb-2">
                        The environment is very inducive to learning. All
                        students are required to speak English within the
                        premises, there is no honor system, all students are
                        treated equally thus removing competition and promoting
                        collaboration within studnets. And I was very much
                        sucked in into this system. I valued academic
                        execellency, I admired my peers' intelligence and
                        passion for learning and used it as in inspiration to be
                        better.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For me, this was an important period of my academic
                        journey. This is private insitution and its environment
                        is very different than what I was used to. I was
                        surrounded with people who are academically excellent
                        and are high achievers. I was pressured to be the same
                        as them, and it did me good. My english speaking and
                        comprehension got good, my grades were above average,
                        and I was very enthusiastic and invested in many areas
                        of my studies. This school had a significant impact in
                        my life and it completely turned my life around.

                        To be honest, I did not really learn much academically
                        during my stay here, I learned more about my peers by
                        being observant. Most of my peers did not really care
                        much for learning, and it is an eye opener for me on how
                        environment affect one's learning.

                        education in here might be below average, but I've seen
                        people's talents and I realized that talents do not
                        diminish with education but can influence it.

                        All of the classes I have had in this school were
                        conducted virtually because of the pandemic. I was
                        again, not very used to it, and it's an entirely
                        different environment. And I became hostile of the
                        system again.

                        Initially, I was very sloppy, I had inconsistent sleep,
                        and I was very critical of virtual classes and I deemed
                        it as an ineffective medium of education. But I learned
                        to live with it, I became flexible, I had full control
                        of my time, and graduated with high honors. During this
                        time, I was very passionate about the things that I do
                        and I was at my peak. I learned many things such as
                        coding, Japanese language, human physiology, psychology,
                        politics, and philosophy.

                        In contrast to my experience in senior high school when
                        I was multi-tasking, I learned in here that if you want
                        to be good or master something you have to invest all
                        your time in your craft. The coding skills I learned in
                        senior high school got reinforced.

                        I also made very good friends and school life with them
                        had been nothing but dopaminergic. I am surrounded with
                        people who are completely different to me, people who
                        have different set of skills, have bright personalities,
                        are great communicators, are extrospective, and there is
                        still so much to discover and learn from them and from
                        this school, I'm looking forward to it.
